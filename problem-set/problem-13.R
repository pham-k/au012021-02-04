# In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other,
# as are 'C' and 'G'.
# The reverse complement of a DNA string s is the string sc 
# formed by reversing the symbols of s,
# then taking the complement of each symbol 
# (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC")

s <- c('AAAACCCGGT')
